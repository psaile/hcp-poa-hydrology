6. [We have a thorough knowledge of the water resources of our world](https://wmo.int/we-have-thorough-knowledge-of-water-resources-of-our-world)
7. [Sustainable development is supported by information covering the full hydrological cycle](https://wmo.int/sustainable-development-supported-hydrological-information)
8. [Water quality is known](https://wmo.int/water-quality-known)

The PoA is regularly reviewed and updated by the WMO [Hydrological Coordination Panel  ](https://community.wmo.int/en/governance/executive-council/executive-council/hydrological-coordination-panel) and its implementation supported by the WMO Secretariat, the WMO Technical Commissions and their relevant Standing Committees, Expert and Task Teams as well as the WMO Regional Associations.
